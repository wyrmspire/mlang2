# Lab Agent Roleplay Prompts

These are the prompts for demonstrating Lab Agent capabilities.
Say "prompt X" to run that scenario.

---

## Prompt 1 (Complete)
"Show me the cleanest long opportunities from last week where price moved fast and never really looked back. I don't care about frequency, just quality."

## Prompt 2
"Find trades that look obvious in hindsight — the kind where you'd say 'how did I miss that?' and tell me what they had in common before they happened."

## Prompt 3
"Run a scan that only fires a few times a week but has strong follow-through. I want fewer signals, not more."

## Prompt 4
"Compare trades that worked in the morning vs trades that worked later in the day and explain the difference in price behavior."

## Prompt 5
"Take one solid setup from the past month and show me three different ways it could have been traded better."

## Prompt 6
"I want to trade momentum, not chop. Find patterns that clearly did not work when price went sideways and tell me how to avoid them."

## Prompt 7
"Build a scan that catches moves right as they start, not after they're obvious. Then show me where it still fails."

## Prompt 8
"Look at the biggest winners in the data and tell me what price usually did in the 30 minutes before entry."

## Prompt 9
"Find setups that work great sometimes and terribly other times. What's different when they fail?"

## Prompt 10
"Create two versions of the same idea: one aggressive and one conservative. Show me the tradeoffs."

## Prompt 11
"If I only traded during the best part of the day, what would that be and why?"

## Prompt 12
"Show me trades where holding longer would have paid off, and trades where holding longer would have made things worse."

## Prompt 13
"Find a setup that looks great on paper but is probably a trap. Explain why."

## Prompt 14
"I want something simple: one or two conditions, no fancy logic. See if simple actually works better."

## Prompt 15
"Take a strategy that performs okay and try to remove rules until it breaks. Tell me which rule actually matters."

## Prompt 16
"Look for patterns that repeat across different weeks, not just one lucky stretch."

## Prompt 17
"If I were only allowed to take 1–2 trades a day, what kind of setups should I be waiting for?"

## Prompt 18
"Show me a strategy that loses money overall but has one specific situation where it's very strong."

## Prompt 19
"Run something experimental that you wouldn't normally recommend, just to see what happens. Then explain the risk."

## Prompt 20
"Take your best idea so far and put it on the chart so I can visually inspect whether it actually makes sense."
